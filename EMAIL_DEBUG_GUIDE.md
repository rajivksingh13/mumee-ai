# Email Service Debugging Guide

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Email API Calls Not Properly Awaited**
**Problem**: Email calls were not being awaited, causing the signup flow to redirect before emails were sent.

**Solution**: 
- Created a `sendWelcomeEmail` helper function that properly awaits the email API call
- Added proper error handling that doesn't fail the signup if email fails
- Ensured email calls complete before redirecting

### 2. **Inconsistent Email Handling**
**Problem**: Different email handling logic between SignUp.tsx and Login.tsx for Google sign-ins.

**Solution**:
- Standardized email handling across both components
- Added consistent error handling and logging
- Improved user experience by not failing signup/login if email fails

### 3. **Silent Email Failures**
**Problem**: Email failures were only logged but not properly handled.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error response parsing
- Improved error messages for debugging
- Added fallback handling for email service issues

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Email Service Configuration
```bash
# Start the server
cd mumee-ai/server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the email service
node scripts/test-email-service.js
```

### 2. Check Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in your server:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test Signup Flow
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Create a new account with email/password
3. Check browser console for email logs
4. Verify email is received

### 4. Test Google Signup Flow
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google sign-in
4. Check browser console for email logs
5. Verify email is received

## Debugging Checklist

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] Check browser console for email API calls
- [ ] Verify API URL is correct
- [ ] Check for CORS errors
- [ ] Verify user creation in Firebase

### Backend Issues
- [ ] Check server logs for email service errors
- [ ] Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
- [ ] Test email configuration endpoint
- [ ] Check domain verification in Resend

### Email Service Issues
- [ ] Verify Resend API key is valid
- [ ] Check domain verification status
- [ ] Test with fallback domain
- [ ] Verify email templates

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "API key not configured"
**Solution**: Set the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable

### 2. "Domain not verified"
**Solution**: 
- Use fallback domain `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Or verify your domain in Resend dashboard

### 3. "CORS error"
**Solution**: Check that your frontend URL is in the allowed origins list

### 4. "Email sent but not received"
**Solution**:
- Check spam folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
