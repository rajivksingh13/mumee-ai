# Signup Email Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing User Type Field**
**Problem**: The user type selection (Individual/Corporate) was removed from the signup form.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added back the user type dropdown with "Individual" and "Corporate" options
- ✅ Added `userType` state management
- ✅ Updated the registration flow to pass user type to backend
- ✅ Updated email service to include account type in welcome emails

### 2. **Email Not Triggering for Regular Signup**
**Problem**: Email was not being sent for regular email/password signup, but working for Google signup.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Enhanced logging to track the entire signup flow
- ✅ Added proper error handling and response parsing
- ✅ Ensured email calls are properly awaited
- ✅ Added detailed console logs for debugging

### 3. **Inconsistent Email Handling**
**Problem**: Different email handling between SignUp.tsx and Login.tsx.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Standardized `sendWelcomeEmail` function across both components
- ✅ Added consistent error handling
- ✅ Improved logging for better debugging

## Code Changes Made

### SignUp.tsx
```typescript
// Added user type state
const [userType, setUserType] = useState('individual');

// Enhanced sendWelcomeEmail function
const sendWelcomeEmail = async (userEmail: string, userName: string, accountType: string) => {
  // Enhanced logging and error handling
};

// Updated registration call
const user = await register(email, password, displayName, userType);

// Added user type field to form
<select value={userType} onChange={(e) => setUserType(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="individual">Individual</option>
  <option value="corporate">Corporate</option>
</select>
```

### authService.ts
```typescript
// Updated register function to accept userType
export const register = async (email: string, password: string, displayName: string, userType: string = 'individual') => {
  // Store userType in Firestore user record
  userType: userType,
};
```

### Login.tsx
```typescript
// Updated sendWelcomeEmail to accept accountType parameter
const sendWelcomeEmail = async (userEmail: string, userName: string, accountType: string = 'individual') => {
  // Consistent error handling
};
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Regular Signup Flow

2. Fill in all fields including:
   - Full Name
   - Email address
   - **Account Type** (Individual or Corporate)
   - Password
   - Confirm Password
   - Accept terms
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Check browser console for logs:
   ```
   🚀 Starting registration process...
   📝 Registration data: { email, displayName, userType }
   ✅ User registered successfully: user_uid
   📧 Attempting to send welcome email...
   📧 Email data: { email, userName, accountType }
   ✅ Welcome email sent successfully: result
   ✅ Email sent successfully, redirecting...
   ```

### 2. Test Google Signup Flow
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google sign-in
4. Check browser console for email logs

### 3. Test Email Service
```bash
# Start the server
cd mumee-ai/server
npm run dev

# Test email service
node scripts/test-email-service.js
```

## Debugging Checklist

### If Email Still Not Triggering:
- [ ] Check browser console for error messages
- [ ] Verify server is running on port 3000
- [ ] Check if RESEND_API_KEY is set in server environment
- [ ] Test email configuration endpoint: `GET /api/email/test-config`
- [ ] Check CORS settings for your frontend URL

### If User Type Not Saving:
- [ ] Check Firestore for userType field in user document
- [ ] Verify registration function is called with userType parameter
- [ ] Check browser console for registration logs

### If Email Sent But Not Received:
- [ ] Check spam folder
- [ ] Verify email address is correct
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- [ ] Test with fallback domain (onboarding@resend.dev)

## Environment Variables Required

### Server (.env file)
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

### Frontend (.env file)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Expected Console Logs

### Successful Signup:
```
🚀 Starting registration process...
📝 Registration data: { email: "test@example.com", displayName: "Test User", userType: "individual" }
✅ User registered successfully: abc123def456
📧 Attempting to send welcome email...
📧 Sending welcome email to: http://localhost:3000/api/email/welcome
📧 Email data: { email: "test@example.com", userName: "Test User", accountType: "individual" }

## Next Steps

1. **Test both signup flows** with the fixes
